## BDM Metamodel Explorer

 This program is built on top of [Alloy](http://alloy.mit.edu) and [JUNG](https://github.com/jrtom/jung). It allows to explore a [semantic domain](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7954405/) partially formalized in an Alloy file (./alloy-models/MDC.als).

 It is a quick and dirty implementation of a prototype. There is no quality claim on the code. It could even be stated that it is an example of what NOT to do.

### Usage

Compile with: ./bin/compile.sh

Run with: ./bin/run.sh
